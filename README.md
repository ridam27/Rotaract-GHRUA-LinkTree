This is a **Linktree-style webpage** created for the Rotaract Club of GHRUA. It serves as a centralized hub for important links such as the club’s Instagram page, bylaws PDF, and membership registration. The registration link is locked by default and becomes accessible only after the bylaws are viewed. The site is responsive and accessible on all devices.

> Built with HTML, CSS (neumorphism style), and JavaScript.
